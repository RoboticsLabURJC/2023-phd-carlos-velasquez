This is my first week of studies in the doctorate, where the work methodology, schedule and tools to use were specified.

It was defined that the operating system to be used is Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, which was installed on a laptop equipped with an Nvidia RTX 4060 graphics card and 16 GB of RAM.

As for the simulator, the Carla 0.9.15 version was chosen, the most recent and stable available. This specific version is deployed within a Docker container to take advantage of the benefits offered by this technology.

In addition, tests of Carla's own API were carried out to verify the correct operation of the simulator, as well as to evaluate the performance of the machine in terms of RAM and GPU memory usage.

Also, the reading of the final master's thesis developed by Vanessa Fernández was carried out, which is directly related to the topic that I want to develop in my thesis work.
